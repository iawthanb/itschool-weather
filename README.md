## Purpose

## API Info

The API source used to display the weather elements is https://openweathermap.org/.

## Usage

The app functions as a regural app to display the weather according to the chosen location. The dropdown button only contains 5 locations (including the already-displayed one).
The first section invites the user to choose the location, the second section shows the current weather for the selected location and the third section displays the weather on a 5-day-forecast basis.
When scrolled to bottom, a small button will show up in the right bottom corner. When clicked, it would scroll up to the top of the page (as a functionality to ease the user's experience on the page).
